                    You will then receive a fundraising page to accept donations and share your
                    campaign. Signing up is easy and every donation is yours to keep, whether
                    or not you reach your goal.

                    to observe to avoid donations being refunded to donors, your
                    fundraiser will remain live until you choose to turn off donations
                    or remove the campaign altogether. Most organizers leave their
                    campaigns active indefinitely to refer back to the kind comments
                    and support they received.

                    No problem. Reaching your goal is not required. With SaveABuiz, you
                    keep each and every donation you receive. Your campaign will be able
                    to accept donations even after your goal is reached. Once the goal
                    is reached, the progress meter on your campaign will show that you
                    have received more than your goal amount. If you&apos;d like to
                    continue raising money, you can keep your campaign running for as
                    long as you&apos;d like.
