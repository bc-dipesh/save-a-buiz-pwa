									<p>
										The best way to have crowdfunding
										explained is to understand that it can
										work for anybody, and there is no cause
										too big or too small for crowdfunding.
										Because of this, it can be hard to
										define crowdfunding. Some people might
										worry that their fundraiser isn&apos;t
										as worthy as others-but the beauty of
										crowdfunding is that it exists to help
										an array of people and needs. Whether
										you want to help your pet, raise money
										to save a business from bankruptcy, or
										get help with bills, crowdfunding can
										allow you to overcome the financial
										barriers that may stand in the way.
									</p>
									<p>
										While most people think crowdfunding
										services are only for individuals who
										need emergency financial assistance,
										businesses looking to fund a new project
										or raise capital can also fundraise
										online. Entrepreneurs can even use
										crowdfunding to finance projects or a
										new creative idea.

										<strong>
											Donation-based crowdfunding:{' '}
										</strong>
										This type of crowdfunding is one of the
										most commone when looking up &apos;What
										is a crowdfunding campaign.&apos; In
										donation-based crowdfunding, people
										search for and support a cause by
										donating to it without receiving
										anything in return. The person running
										the fundraiser isnâ€™t obligated to pay
										back donors or give them anything else
										in return for their contributions.
										SaveABuiz is also one of the major
										crowdfunding sites that uses
										donation-based crowdfunding.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											Equity-based crowdfunding:{' '}
										</strong>
										In equity-based fundraising, the
										fundraiser organizer accepts money from
										people looking to invest, typically to
										help launch a business. In return,
										investors will receive a small piece of
										equity in the business or company.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Rewards-based</strong>: Through
										rewards-based crowdfunding on platforms
										like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, the
										organizer of the fundraiser provides a
										reward or products to donors, usually a
										service or physical item, in exchange
										for a contribution.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											Note: SaveABuiz only allows
											donation-based crowdfunding.
